      <h2>And what if there was a recipe for creativity?</h2>
    
      <p>
        Creating an <strong>innovative concept</strong> is an original way to combine different business components (users, resources, advantages, etc.). Creating a new menu is an innovative way to cook different ingredients. Sometimes it seems classical, sometimes original, sometimes really exotic. It depends of your ingredients and of your cooking method. Imagine that we have prepare for you a range of these innovation ingredients. What would you cook? How will people react when tasting?
      </p>
      
      <p><strong>Story Juice</strong> is an ideation platform dedicated to support innovation. Innovation challenges are often complex and not precisely defined. This discourages many people giving their opinion and generate feasible, original or even disruptive ideas. Story Juice was created in order to engage large groups of participants (customers, employees, citizens, students) in the innovation adventure!  Our goal is to reveal peopleâ€™s creativity in order to imagine new ideas of products, services or process to support innovation. The creativity and games mechanisms beyond this platform are validated by academic research and from return from experience from large private and public organizations.</p>
    
    
      <p><strong>Our method is based on 4 steps:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>We analyze your innovation situation</li>
        <li>We structure it according to ideation framework</li>
        <li>We share it with participants using game mechanism</li>
        <li>We collect ideas and data to enrich your innovation process</li>
      </ul>
